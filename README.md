## The goal is to analyze and prepare an action plan for customer retention.

- learn how to predict the probability of outflow (at the level of the next month) for each client;
- form typical customer portraits: identify several of the most striking groups and characterize their main properties;
- analyze the main features that most strongly affect the outflow;
- formulate the main conclusions and develop recommendations for improving the quality of work with clients:
    1) identify target customer groups;
    2) propose measures to reduce churn;
    3) determine other features of interaction with customers.
